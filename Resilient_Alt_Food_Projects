# Resilience and Alternative Food Projects

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring and developing innovative solutions to sustain global food security in the event of large-scale catastrophes that threaten traditional agricultural practices. It is based on principles outlined in "Feeding Everyone No Matter What," focusing on the resilience of food systems and the deployment of alternative food production methodologies.

## Objective
The central aim is to mitigate the risk of mass starvation following potential global catastrophes that could lead to severe disruptions in agricultural production. Such events include but are not limited to super volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, nuclear winters, abrupt climate change, and the rapid spread of plant pathogens or pests.

## Background
Historical strategies for avoiding widespread hunger have predominantly revolved around increasing food storage. However, stockpiling food on a scale necessary to feed the entire global population is both time-intensive and likely to cause food prices to spike, leading to immediate accessibility issues. In response to these challenges, our work focuses on practical, cost-effective strategies for distributed food production.

## Research and Development
Led by insights from Dr. Pearce and Dr. Denkenberger's work, our research in Fast, Adaptable, Simple, and Timely food solutions includes:

- **Leaf Concentrate Production**: Investigating methods to create high-protein food sources from leaf biomass.
- **Seaweed and Algal Cultivation**: Developing techniques to efficiently grow and harvest edible seaweeds and algae.
- **Lignocellulosic Conversion**: Exploring processes to convert wood and other lignocellulosic materials into edible substances.
- **Waste-to-Food Technology**: Examining radical approaches to transform waste plastics and other materials into viable foodstuffs using open source technologies.

## Collaboration
We encourage collaboration and contributions from researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts in the fields of sustainable development, food science, manufacturing, and open-source innovation. The goal is to pool knowledge and expertise to create scalable solutions that can be rapidly deployed in crisis situations.
