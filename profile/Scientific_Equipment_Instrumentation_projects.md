# Open Source Scientific Equipment and Instrumentation (OSSEI)

## Overview
This repository is part of our broader commitment to open-source hardware (OSH), specifically focusing on the development and sharing of scientific equipment and instrumentation (EI). The Open Source Hardware for Scientific Equipment and Instrumentation (OSSEI) repository supports the design, creation, and improvement of open-source scientific tools, reflecting a dedication to innovation, cost reduction, and enhanced accessibility of scientific EI for research and educational purposes globally.

## Mission
The mission of the OSSEI is to enable scientists, educators, and hobbyists to build, modify, and share scientific equipment more freely. By creating a repository of open-source designs, documentation, and software, the OSSEI aims to democratize access to scientific instrumentation.

## Core Objectives
- **Development of Open-Source Tools**: Streamlining the creation of scientific equipment that is cost-effective, customizable, and transparent in design.
- **Community Collaboration**: Encouraging a collaborative environment where individuals and organizations can contribute to and benefit from shared knowledge.
- **Educational Outreach**: Providing educational institutions with the resources needed to integrate open-source equipment into their curricula and research programs.

## Projects and Initiatives
- **Design Repository**: A curated collection of open-source designs and instructions for scientific equipment.
- **Prototyping Workshops**: Events and workshops focused on building, testing, and refining scientific instruments.
- **Integration of Digital Fabrication**: Using technologies like 3D printing and CNC machining to create or improve scientific tools.

## Strategic Pillars
- **Innovation**: Driving the creation of new scientific instruments that can be easily reproduced and customized.
- **Quality and Safety**: Ensuring that open-source scientific equipment meets high standards of quality and safety for use in various research contexts.
- **Sustainability**: Promoting the use of environmentally responsible materials and methods in the manufacturing of scientific tools.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Contributions should include comprehensive documentation for replication and adaptation.
- Designs must prioritize ease of assembly, affordability, and accessibility of materials.
- Contributions should adhere to best practices for safety and reliability in a laboratory setting.
- Enhancements to existing tools should be clearly documented, including the rationale for design changes.

## Getting Involved
- **Innovate**: Contribute your own designs for scientific equipment or improve upon existing ones.
- **Collaborate**: Join ongoing projects to refine and enhance the utility of open-source scientific tools.
- **Educate**: Help to create and share educational materials that leverage these open-source resources for learning.
