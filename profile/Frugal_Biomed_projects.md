# Frugal Biomedical Innovation Projects

## Overview
The Frugal Biomedical Innovations (FBI) Program is a cross-disciplinary initiative within the overarching research group focused on the co-design, development, and deployment of medical technologies. This program is being ran by Western University with the aim to enhance healthcare accessibility in remote and resource-limited environments.

## Mission
Adopting the tenets of "frugal innovation," the FBI Program seeks to spur research and education in creating cost-effective and efficient biomedical solutions. These solutions are directed at serving and empowering underserved communities globally.

## Pillars of the Program
- **Education**: Cultivating hands-on learning experiences for students in frugal medical device design and deployment, preparing them for impactful careers in the biomedical field.
- **Technology Development**: Accelerating the innovation process from conceptual design to prototype testing, leading towards the practical application and commercialization of medical devices.
- **Implementation**: Facilitating a deeper understanding of the healthcare landscape in various contexts, fostering global partnerships, and driving the scale-up of biomedical innovations.

## Objectives
- To bridge the gap between advanced medical technology and the needs of remote and low-resource communities.
- To create an educational platform that equips the next generation of engineers and researchers with the skills needed for frugal innovation.
- To foster collaborations that translate to tangible healthcare improvements in Indigenous territories in Canada and underserved regions in Africa.

## Projects and Initiatives
- **Educational Workshops**: Integrating practical design and prototyping projects into the curriculum.
- **Prototype Development**: Iterating frugal medical devices through stages of design, testing, and validation.
- **Field Testing**: Deploying medical prototypes in partnership with local healthcare providers and assessing their impact.

## Collaboration and Partnerships
- **Academic Collaborations**: Engaging with educational institutions to enhance research and learning outcomes.
- **Industry Partnerships**: Aligning with medical device companies for expertise and scaling potential.
- **Community Engagement**: Working directly with local leaders and healthcare workers to ensure that innovations meet real-world needs.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Submissions should prioritize affordability, accessibility, and user-friendliness.
- Innovations must be adaptable to diverse environments and resilient to challenging conditions.
- Projects should have clear documentation for replication, scalability, and impact assessment.
- Proposals must consider the ethical implications and cultural sensitivities of medical device deployment.

## Getting Involved
- **Explore**: Investigate current FBI projects and their impacts on healthcare accessibility.
- **Contribute**: Offer your insights, designs, or research findings to enrich the FBI Program.
- **Innovate**: Propose new solutions or improvements for existing frugal biomedical devices.
- **Engage**: Assist in implementing frugal innovations within partner communities.
