# Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Projects

## Overview
This repository is devoted to the development and dissemination of solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies and projects. Solar PV has been recognized as a cost-effective and sustainable energy source, offering the lowest cost electricity in many markets, including North America.

## Mission
The mission of FAST within the realm of PV is to further reduce costs and optimize design for enhanced effectiveness. This involves leveraging Free and Open Source Hardware (FOSH) for data sensing and logging, improving yield, and exploring innovative PV system designs.

## Objectives
- To advance the adoption of solar PV as the dominant, sustainable energy source of the future.
- To optimize PV system designs for increased efficiency and lower costs.
- To explore and implement novel PV applications such as agrivoltaics, floatovoltaics, building-integrated PV (BIPV), and PV-powered electric vehicle charging.
- To integrate PV with other technologies, such as heat pumps, for a comprehensive approach to sustainable electrification.
- To provide accessible, open-source designs and methodologies for global adoption.

## Projects and Highlights
- **Agrivoltaics**: Exploring synergies between agriculture and PV with new racking systems, cell types, and greenhouse integrations.
- **Floatovoltaics**: Implementing floating PV systems that conserve water and benefit from cooling effects.
- **Open Source BIPV**: Developing integrations of PV into building structures to enhance aesthetic and functional aspects.
- **Heat Pumps and PV**: Coupling PV with heat pumps to facilitate renewable heating solutions.
- **PV-Powered Transportation**: Creating infrastructure for electric vehicle charging powered by PV systems.
- **WIRED System**: Constructing a testbed for open-source PV systems to drive cost reductions and agrivoltaic innovations.

## Upcoming Events
